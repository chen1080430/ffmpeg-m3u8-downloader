ffmpeg m3u8 downloader

This tool is for m3u8 stream video file download.

To download m3u8 file, you need to get the video URL first, which is end up with ".m3u8".
After getting the video URL, this tool can help you download the video you want.

I put ffmpeg folder and file with batch together, you can directly use this tool to download video or update ffmpeg then download, it's up to you.

The feature of this tool is "multi download", you can input several video URL and let these videos download one by one.
Just click enter several times, and you can see video file which format is .mp4 inside the folder for a while.

Enjoy this tool, and feel free to ask any question, I would appreciate it if you have any advice for me.
